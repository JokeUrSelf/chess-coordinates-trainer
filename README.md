# Chess Coordinates Trainer (Alfa)
Have you ever tried playing chess blindfolded? If you said yes, then you're probably well aware of the fact that remembering a square's coordinate can cost you a significant amount of time.

To solve this problem and increase efficiency of your chess, I present to you the "Chess Coordinate Trainer".
It is a React application which helps you create a mental map between the coordinates and its corresponding squares.

### How to use
The app is currently in Alfa and has no online support. If you still want to try it out, you can `clone` this repository and launch it via console by typing `npm start` in the cloned directory (you need to have `node.js` installed on your computer beforehand)
