# Chess Coordinates Trainer
Have you ever tried playing chess blindfolded, or simply trying to understand chess moves verbally?
Sometimes it's tough to understand what square exactly is represented by the coordinate.

Therefore I present to you chess coordinate trainer. It is a react application with the goal to make you remember the squares of the board, by typing their coordinates into the text field.
